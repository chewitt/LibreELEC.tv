Subject: [PATCH 23/51] rockchip: Ensure env in SPI Flash can work correctly

Ensure that the spi/sfc node for SPI flash is aviliable during pre-reloc
phase so that env can successfully be loaded from SPI Flash.

No boards with these SoCs seem to be affected as there is no default use
of ENV_IS_IN_SPI_FLASH=y.
