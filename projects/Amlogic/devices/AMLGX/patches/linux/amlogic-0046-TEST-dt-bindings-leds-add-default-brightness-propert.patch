Subject: [PATCH 46/54] TEST: dt-bindings: leds: add default-brightness
 property to common.yaml
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add default-brightness property to leds/common.yaml to establish a single
canonical definition for LED brightness initialization.

The property is currently defined locally in leds/leds-pwm.yaml and is
needed by auxdisplay/titanmec,tm16xx.yaml. Properties should be defined
in only one location to avoid type inconsistencies across bindings.
